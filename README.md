# weAR – Virtual Fitting Room SaaS Platform

> Graduation Project – Role-Based SaaS Architecture with AI Integration

---

## 📖 Overview

**weAR** is a B2B SaaS platform that enhances online retail experiences using Virtual Fitting Room (VFR) technology.

The platform supports three user roles:

- 🛍 Retailers (B2B Dashboard)
- 🛒 Customers (B2C Storefront)
- 🔑 Super Admins (Platform Management)

This project demonstrates scalable frontend architecture, modular design, role-based routing, and AI feature integration.

## 🏗 Architecture Strategy

We implemented a **Single SPA + Domain-Driven Modular Architecture**.

### Why this approach?

- Clean separation of concerns
- Role-based isolation
- Scalable structure
- Graduation timeline friendly
- Avoids over-engineering

Each user role is treated as a mini-system inside a unified application.
